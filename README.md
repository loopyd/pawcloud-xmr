# pawcloud-xmr
## A useful toolkit for cloud miners to help them mine XMR (RandomX) easier.

This repository comes without any documentation.  It is for expert users, and there is no support provided for you.

This repository goes paw-in-paw with the (XMR Proxy)[https://github.com/loopyd/xmr-node-proxy] fork, as a PoC for its use. Snipa22's original work has issues, and hadn't been updated since mid-2017.  This project supercedes his work with updates to get it working on modern cloud platforms.

Snipa22 or any Monero/XMR staff are not affiliated with this project in any way shape or form.  As such, donation links and details have been sanitized from the proxy fork used in this project.

You use this project at your own risk.  It goes largely unmaintained for the most part, and only recieves upddates when it stops working for me.

# Contributions

If you have contributions, please submit to me a merge pull request on this repository.  I cannot provide an appnyer or a travis build layer for this repository because it procudes working cryptominer nodes which I'm fairly certain would get this account deleted and me banned from Microsoft Azure every time somebody submits to me a PR.  A huge no-no.

Test your code to ensure its working, and please use proper netiquite when corresponding on the Issue Tracker.

You can offer crypto donations for this work to my wallet address on a purely voluntary basis. This wallet address is included by default in the code here for testing purposes.  During the normal process of configuring your miner, you will of course delete and change this.  As stated, donation functionality has been removed from xmr-node-proxy completely, and will never be a functional part of the project when you remove my wallet address from the miner that is built using this set of tools.

That address is:

Thank you for your voluntary donations.
